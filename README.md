## Gradient Tree Boosting

Here you will find a Jupyter Notebook explaining the Gradient Tree Boosting algorithm. The notebook includes an example using a dataset related to the risk of a heart attack.

The notebook was written in **German** and was part of a machine learning course during my studies. It provides a step-by-step explanation of the Gradient Tree Boosting technique, along with code examples, data analysis, and evaluation techniques.
